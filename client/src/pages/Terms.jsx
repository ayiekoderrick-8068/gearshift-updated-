          By creating an account or using GearShift, you agree to these terms. Renters must hold a
          valid driving license and are responsible for the vehicle for the duration of their
          booking, including any traffic fines incurred. Owners are responsible for ensuring
          listed vehicles are roadworthy, insured, and accurately described.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bookings are confirmed at the vehicle owner's discretion. Cancellations of a pending
          booking are free; once confirmed, cancellation terms are agreed directly between renter
          and owner. GearShift facilitates the connection between parties and is not itself a
          vehicle owner or insurer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accounts found to violate these terms - including fraudulent listings, non-payment, or
          abuse of other users - may be suspended or banned at GearShift's discretion.
