// Public route: /faq - modeled on a reference "FAQ for tourists" design
// (bold question, plain-text answer, ending in a contact form). Content is
// kept honest to what GearShift actually does - no claims about features
// that aren't real (e.g. child seats or card/PayPal payment aren't modeled
// anywhere in the app, so they're left out rather than promised here).

  {
    q: "Do you allow self-drive for tourists?",
    a: "Yes. Every listing can be booked self-drive with a valid driving license (an international driving permit works too), or with one of our professional chauffeurs if you'd rather not drive yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm an international traveller - can I still rent a car?",
    a: "Yes. Your home-country license or an international driving permit (IDP) is accepted for self-drive, or choose \"with chauffeur\" if you'd rather not navigate unfamiliar roads yourself.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Kenyan phone number to book?",
    a: "Yes - every booking needs a contact number in the +254 format, since that's how we and the vehicle owner reach you. A local SIM or a Kenyan WhatsApp number both work; your hotel or tour operator can usually help you get one on arrival.",
  },
  {
    q: "What currency are prices shown in?",
    a: "All rates on GearShift are listed in Kenyan Shillings (KES). If you're budgeting from abroad, check your card or bank's exchange rate before booking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I take a car to the Maasai Mara or other parks?",
    a: "Yes. Filter vehicles by the Safari category, or use the event booking flow for a dedicated safari trip - our SUVs and 4x4s are built for game-park roads.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which cities do you operate in?",
    a: "Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret today. Browse by location on the vehicles page to see what's available near you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I hire a car with a chauffeur instead of self-drive?",
    a: "Yes. When booking, choose \"With chauffeur\" and pick from our rated chauffeurs - their daily rate is added on top of the vehicle's rate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book several vehicles at once, e.g. for a wedding or group trip?",
    a: "Yes - our event/convoy booking flow lets you book multiple vehicles together for weddings, funerals, safaris, and group transport, with a discount that scales up the more you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you make sure listed vehicles are safe to rent?",
    a: "Every listing is reviewed and approved by our admin team before it goes live, and both owners and renters build a public rating from real completed bookings.",
  },
